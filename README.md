It is a console based python project developed using Python in Spyder IDE.

It implements AI algorithms of Informed and Uninformed searches which includes BFS, DFS, UCS,  A* Search and Greedy Search

For every search we finds the solution and explains, is the solution optimal and also define the number of nodes that were expanded by the algorithm.

Project was developed in Fall 2019 Semester. It was Artificial Intelligence Course's semester project.
